1) removed names domain*, target*
  - most methods are now parametrized with a 
    template parameter <int grid> \in [0,1]
  - the other ones are now called grid(0|1)Foo instead of (domain|target)Foo
2) iterators are real iterators. All information, e.g. coorddim, has
   to be obtained from the value_type.
3) the RemoteIntersection & RemoteIntersectionIterator interface are
   removed. We have only one implementation (GridGlue::RemoteIntersection(Iterator))
4) the parameters of GridGlue changed:
   * GridGlue<Trait1, Trait2> -> GridGlue<Patch1, Patch2>
   * GridGlue(GV1, GV2)       -> GridGlue(Patch1, Patch2)
5) the Patch (aka Extractor) needs to be constructed before.
   * it consists of a GridView and a predicate
   * GridGlue doesn't store the predicate itself anymore
   <code>
   Predicate predicate(...);
   Patch<GridView> patch(gridView, predicate);
   </code>
