1) removed names domain*, target*
  - most methods are now parametrized with a 
    template parameter <int grid> \in [0,1]
  - the other ones are now called grid(0|1)Foo instead of (domain|target)Foo
2) iterators are real iterators. All information, e.g. coorddim, has
   to be obtained from the value_type.
3) the RemoteIntersection & RemoteIntersectionIterator interface are
   removed. We have only one implementation (GridGlue::RemoteIntersection(Iterator))
